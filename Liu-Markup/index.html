            <p>During a recent visit to the UC Davis Design Museum, I had the privilege of exploring the
                current exhibit, “<em>STILL: Racism in America, A Retrospective in Cartoons</em>” for the first time.
                While the experience was enlightening, I also noticed areas where the exhibit could be refined. I
                will explore these elements in this memorandum and suggest improvements to enhance the
                space.</p>
        </div>

        <section>
            <h4>Introduction</h4>

            <p>The purpose of this report is to analyze the visual rhetoric of the museum and assess how well
                the museum/curator did in delivering the media. Based on the <a
                    href="https://arts.ucdavis.edu/designmuseum">UC Davis Museum website</a>, The
                Museum aims to enhance the teaching and research activities of the UC Davis Design
                Department by providing a space for design students to showcase their work and learn effective
                presentation techniques. Additionally, their exhibition program highlights the work of innovative
                designers, delves into design issues, showcases the design collection, and functions as a valuable
                teaching and learning resource for faculty and students in the Department of Design and
                throughout UC Davis. Furthermore, the goal of the current exhibition, “<em>STILL: Racism in
                    America, A Retrospective in Cartoons</em>”, is to explore racism through cartoons.</p>

            <p>To guide me with this analysis, I asked the following observational questions:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>What was your initial impression of the site or virtual space?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Did the space feel inviting, and what was the overall atmosphere?</li>
                        <li>Were there clear indications or guides on where to start or what to see
                            first?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Did you notice any elements that promoted or encouraged focused attention?</li>
                <li>Did the overall environment make you inclined to stay longer?</li>
                <li>In your opinion, does the site effectively achieve its intended goal?</li>
                <li>Would you recommend this museum to others?</li>
                <li>Do you see yourself returning? If so, what would motivate you to come back?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>From addressing those questions and going through the museum, the museum was successful on
                delivery media.</p>

            <h4>Interactive Elements</h4>

            <p>In his exploration of interactive elements in informal settings such as museums, Screven
                highlights their impact on visitor attention. He notes that visitors tend to have a higher attention
                span and are more engaged when interactive elements are incorporated into the museum
                experience. However, Screven emphasizes that these interactive elements must be relevant to the
                exhibition and offer a meaningful learning experience to be effective.</p>

                <figcaption>Figure 1: Spotify Playlist Poster</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                During my visit to the UC Davis Design Museum, I
                identified two interactive elements: a Spotify playlist
                and a board game. Figure 1 shows the Spotify
                playlist, located at the museum's entrance, which was
                curated by the exhibition designer Barbara
                Brandon-Croft to complement the museum viewing
                experience. It features songs by black artists, aligning
                with the purpose of the exhibition. While the concept
                was creative, I found the execution lacking. The
                poster displaying the playlist seemed somewhat plain
                compared to the museum's overall vibe, giving the
                impression of being hastily put together.
                Additionally, the QR code linked to a website with
                ads, detracted from the immersive experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, interactive elements such as the Spotify
                playlist have the potential to enrich visitors' museum
                experience by offering a unique and engaging way to
                interact with the exhibition's themes. However, these elements must be thoughtfully designed
                and integrated into the museum's overall aesthetic and purpose to maximize their impact.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="assets/boardgame.png" alt="boardgame activity" width="383" height="215">
                <figcaption>Figure 2: CULLD Board Game</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Another captivating interactive element within the exhibition is the CULLUD Board Game, Figure 2.
                The display includes the Cullud board, dice and figures, an enlarged version of the board, and an
                instruction manual. This element proved to be both engaging and educational, adding a layer of fun to
                the overall museum experience. Personally, it left me eager to return with a companion to enjoy the game
                together, showcasing how such elements can entice visitors to revisit the museum. I particularly
                appreciated the element's placement behind the X-shaped wall, as it felt like a hidden gem that revived
                my interest in the museum when my attention was starting to disappear. However, it could be argued that
                placing this display in a more visible location, such as the X wall facing the entrance, could attract
                more attention from passersby, potentially drawing in a larger audience.
            </p>

            <p>
                In conclusion, both the Spotify playlist and the CULLUD Board Game demonstrate the potential of
                interactive
                elements to enrich visitors' museum experiences by offering engaging ways to interact with exhibition
                themes. For these elements to be effective, they must be carefully designed and integrated into the
                museum's
                aesthetic and purpose. Strategically placing interactive displays can not only revive visitor interest
                but
                also encourage return visits, enhancing overall engagement. As museums evolve, incorporating such
                innovative
                elements will be essential for maintaining relevance and fostering meaningful connections with
                audiences.

            <h4>Exhibition Focus and Layout</h4>

            <p>
                The museum's focus on the current exhibition, "STILL: Racism in America, A Retrospective in
                Cartoons," was different from what I anticipated. I had expected to see a combination of student
                work alongside the exhibition but found that only the current exhibition was on display. This
                diminished my interest somewhat, as I had been particularly looking forward to seeing student
                work, being a student myself. Visitors who, like me, had checked the website beforehand may
                have shared similar feelings of disappointment. Despite this, the museum was easy to navigate,
                located prominently as the first room upon entering from the front entrance. The website also
                provided clear directions and instructions on how to get to Cruess Hall, where the museum is
                located. This ease of access is a significant advantage, ensuring that visitors can find and
                experience the museum without difficulty.

            <h4>Welcoming Atmosphere</h4>

            <figure>
                <img src="assets/entrance.png" alt="Museum view from the entrance" width="365" height="205">
                <figcaption>Figure 3: Museum view from the entrance</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Upon entering the museum, my initial impression was that it was warm and welcoming as shown in Figure
                3. The lighting, with its warm tones, created a cozy and inviting atmosphere. This aligns with
                Vonn's
                idea in "<em>THE PSYCHOLOGY OF LIGHT: HOW DIFFERENT LIGHTING IMPACTS OUR EMOTIONS</em>," which suggests
                that warm
                tones are associated with feelings of comfort and relaxation. As I explored the museum, I found this to
                be
                true, feeling at ease within the space. In the center of the room, there is a bench where visitors can
                sit
                and relax. During my visit, I observed another visitor reading a book and enjoying the peaceful
                ambiance.
                This scene further highlights the museum's welcoming and relaxing atmosphere.

        <section>
            <h4>Strategic Lighting and Color Scheme</h4>

            <figure>
                <img src="assets/wall.png" alt="Displaying showing light spotlight" width="313" height="272">
                <figcaption>Figure 4: Light Spotlight</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Another notable aspect of the museum's lighting is how each light is strategically positioned to shine on
                the
                exhibition displays as shown in Figure 4. This creates a spotlight effect, drawing attention to
                and
                highlighting each display. This not only enhances the visual appeal of the exhibits but also helps guide
                visitors' focus and engagement. Contrasted to the darker red and black backgrounds, the spotlight
                lighting
                draws attention to the displays even more. Regarding the color scheme, the main colors for the walls are
                red, black, and white, matching the event poster and the black-and-white cartoon displays. The bold red
                background makes the displays stand out. In “<em>First Impressions: Perception and Genres</em>”,
                Hilligos talked
                about how powerful color is when it comes to focusing attention. From their research, they found that
                colors
                help readers find, organize, and make decisions about complex information. However, the overuse of color
                can
                also distract and overwhelm the readers. In this case, I think the museum did a good job of balancing
                the
                colors used. There wasn’t an overwhelming amount of colors being used in the space that would distract
                visitors from the actual displays. The colors not only match the displays aesthetically but also draw
                attention to them.

            <h4>Texts</h4>

            <figure>
                <img src="assets/text.png" alt="Displaying Notes" width="322" height="211">
                <figcaption>Figure 5: Displaying Notes</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Compared to other museums I've visited, this exhibition featured concise description cards with only a
                few
                sentences each as shown in Figure 5(bottom). This approach made it easier for me to understand and learn
                about the displays compared to the long paragraphs often found in museum exhibits. The shortness of text
                not
                only suited my low attention span but also emphasized the importance of each display. This aligns with
                Screven's research, which suggests that visitors prefer exhibits that are concise, engaging, and
                relatable.
                Displays that "come to life," convey messages quickly, and relate to familiar experiences are more
                favored.
                Conversely, visitors dislike overly complex exhibits, lack personal connections, or feel disconnected
                from
                the real world. This highlights the appeal of short, direct texts in museums, as they are more likely to
                captivate visitors, aid in learning, and facilitate information retention. The display notes, often
                reflecting Barbara Croft's thoughts, further enhance this sense of familiarity and connection,
                ultimately
                enriching the visitor's experience.

            <h4>Conclusions</h4>
            <p>
                In conclusion, the UC Davis Design Museum has effectively utilized delivery media and visual rhetoric to
                enhance visitor experiences. The strategic use of interactive elements, such as the Spotify playlist and
                the
                CULLUD Board Game, has enriched the exhibition's themes and engaged visitors. The museum's welcoming
                atmosphere was highlighted by warm lighting and a thoughtful color scheme, creating a comfortable
                environment conducive to learning and reflection. Additionally, the concise and engaging texts provide
                clear
                and impactful information, enhancing visitors' understanding and retention of the exhibition's messages.
            </p>
            <p>
                To further improve the museum's delivery media and visual rhetoric, I recommend enhancing the Spotify
                playlist experience by refining its execution. This could include improving the design of the poster and
                ensuring that the QR code leads to a seamless and immersive experience without distractions.
                Additionally,
                considering the placement of interactive elements, such as the CULLUD Board Game, to maximize visibility
                and
                attract more visitors could enhance the overall impact of these elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, the UC Davis Design Museum has effectively utilized various elements of delivery media and
                visual
                rhetoric to create a compelling and engaging exhibition experience. These efforts have succeeded in
                making
                the museum a valuable educational resource and a memorable destination for visitors.

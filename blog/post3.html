                <h2> Comparative Analysis </h2>
                <time datetime="2025-07-14"> July 21st, 2025</time>

                <p>For my interactive narrative project, I am working on a website called Message in a Bottle. The idea
                    is
                    to recreate messages in bottles that float on the ocean. People can click on a bottle, read
                    anonymous
                    messages, and either reply or toss the bottle back into the sea. It is meant to be like a little
                    ocean
                    of thoughts. </p>

                <p>Of course, I had to do some research and see if there are any websites that already exists with the
                    same
                    idea. Fortunately, I couldn’t find anything similar, but I did find this wonderful website that has
                    a
                    similar UI concept that I am going for. </p>

                <h4>LA Rosee Paris</h4>
                <p><a href="https://popup.larosee-cosmetiques.com/" id="LARosee">link to site </a></p>

                <p>The website is in French, so I couldn’t fully understand what the website is about. However, I am
                    assuming that it is a website that shows off their product. </p>

                <p>What makes this website unique is that it is interactive. The background is 3D graphics of their
                    store,
                    and you can click on each item to learn more about it. </p>

                <h4>What I like:</h4>

                <div class="imgCardWrapper">

                    <div class="imgCard">
                        <img src="images/minimal.png" alt="screenshot of LA Rosee Homepage">
                        <p>There is a lot of stuff on the screen, yet it feels minimal since it is clearly indicted with
                            the
                            dots that there are only 3 things you can click on</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="imgCard">
                        <img src="images/interactive.png" alt="screenshot of purse item pop up">
                        <p>The website is fully interactive and immerse. It is like I am exploring the actual store but
                            digitally</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="imgCard">
                        <img src="images/storyTelling.png" alt="lock to cafe">
                        <p>It feels like I am going on a journey. It has a story telling aspect where I have to explore
                            everything on one section before unlocking the next</p>
                    </div>

                </div>

                <p>The website is so good that I honestly won’t change anything about it. The color theme is great. It
                    is
                    responsive and doesn’t take that long to load. </p>

                <p>I also plan to do have the same UI where user would click something and a description of it will pop
                    up.
                    My original idea was to have the pop up cover up the whole screen but I kind of like the side by
                    side
                    view that LA Rosee has. I will incorporate that into my website and hopefully my website will look
                    as
                    great as theirs!</p>

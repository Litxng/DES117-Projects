                <h2> The Three Layers of the Web </h2>
                <time>2025-06-25</time>

                <p>There are 3 parts of the web: the surface web, the deep web, and the dark web. The surface web is
                    easily
                    searchable and is open to the public. It includes websites like Google, YouTube, and CNN.</p>
                <p>The deep web refers to websites that aren’t searchable and require the exact URL or login credentials
                    to
                    access them. This includes items such as emails and bank logins.</p>
                <p>The dark web is only accessible with a specific browser called Tor, and users can browse anonymously.
                    The
                    dark web began in 2000 with the release of Freenet by a student, Ian Clarke. Clarke wanted to create
                    a
                    new way to anonymously communicate and share files online. This kick-started the Tor project, which
                    was
                    released in 2002 and launched a browser in 2008. With Tor, users can now browse the internet
                    completely
                    anonymously.</p>
                <p>Originally, Tor was used by the United States Department of Defense to communicate anonymously, but
                    the
                    dark web has now become a place for users who want to stay anonymous around the world. The dark web
                    uses
                    a technology called “onion routing” that protects users from being traced.</p>
                <p>With that technology, people use the dark web for illegal purposes like selling drugs, data,
                    trading/distributing illegal pornography, and other harmful acts.</p>
                <p>To access the dark web, you first need to download Tor. To get into dark web websites, you will need
                    the
                    exact URL, so select a dark web search engine like DuckDuckGo that can help you find dark web
                    websites
                    that can’t be traced by traditional surface web search engines. Dark web websites have a .onion URL.
                    Finally, make sure to have a VPN and strong antimalware software to prevent illegal attacks.</p>
                <p>I have never tried to go into the dark web since I am too scared of getting doxxed. I remember
                    watching
                    scary animated story videos of people going into the dark web and getting into websites that they
                    shouldn’t be getting into, and then getting killed or something.</p>
                <p>Although the dark web is known to be dangerous and illegal, I feel like the surface web is just as
                    dangerous. Since I pretty much grew up on the internet, looking back on it, I had no cyber awareness
                    at
                    all, and I am sure that is the case for a lot of young people out there.</p>
                <p>I have met a lot of weirdos that I blindly trusted. I even tried Skype calling my “online friends”
                    and
                    accidentally turned my camera on. With the internet being built into our daily lives, I think
                    cybersecurity should be taught to young people.</p>

                <h2> Web Design Research </h2>
                <time datetime="2025-07-25"> July 25th, 2025</time>

                <p>I recently watched a video called <em>“Why is CSS so Weird?”</em>, and it made me think about a main
                    theme that’s been emphasized throughout this course: accessibility and responsiveness. CSS covers
                    both
                    of those things. It’s built to accommodate all kinds of devices and users. It’s powerful because of
                    its
                    relative sizing, natural flow, and adaptability.</p>

                <p>As a designer, I naturally gravitate toward making things look pretty and aesthetically pleasing, but
                    I’ve realized I often unconsciously overlook accessibility. Being in this class and actually coding
                    my
                    designs made me realize that simplicity is more important than flashy or “cool” visuals. I had to
                    scrap
                    a lot of my original ideas because they relied too much on pixel-perfect graphic placements—and
                    that’s
                    not what CSS is built for, nor what modern websites should do.</p>

                <p>I also recently read an article called “Liquid Glass Design or Kitsch?” about the rise of
                    glassmorphism,
                    one of the latest UI/UX trends. Apple recently released a new UI design centered around this style.
                    I
                    was surprised to see Apple leaning into it, given that accessibility is one of glassmorphism’s
                    biggest
                    challenges. The transparent, blurred backgrounds can make text hard to read, and sometimes the
                    visuals
                    are just too distracting. Since the new UI is still in beta, I’m sure Apple will refine it further
                    to
                    make it both functional and visually appealing.</p>

                <p>Both the video and the article helped me realize that good design isn’t just about how things
                    look—it’s
                    about how well they work for everyone. Whether it’s writing flexible CSS or using visual effects
                    like
                    glassmorphism, accessibility and responsiveness should always come first.</p>

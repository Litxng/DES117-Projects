Where I live


You will mainly find me in my boyfriend's room! The image above is our room, but it's drawn! I spend most of my time here since my boyfriend is my best friend and I hang out with him the most!

I am a full time student and a part time barista at a boba shop! I love making drinks and it is a stress reliever for me.


Main Interest


When I am not working, I like to do things that keep me busy and doesn’t require much thinking since I am already thinking enough in school. 


Gaming


I love love love gaming!!!! I grew up playing Minecraft, and then had an Rainbow Six Siege addiction on ps5, then when I got a PC, I started playing Valorant. Now that I am a full-time student and have a job, I don’t really have time for high-stress time time-consuming games, so I play single-player games like Mortal Kombat and Hearthstone!


Diamond Painting


Diamond painting is one of my favorite hobbies for stress relieving since all I need to do is put little diamond squares on a canvas. I don’t have to think or anything which is perfect after stressful exams!


Legos


I think Legos are the funnest thing ever created. I specifically love car legos since I like cars and like building legos! I also like other building block things that aren’t lego brand but I just like building things in general!
